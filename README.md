# Iris-Flower-Classification-with-Machine-Learning-Using-Python-CodeAlpha
In this project, I developed a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into different species based on their physical characteristics. Using Python, I utilized the famous Iris dataset, which includes measurements such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three iris species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. I explored and visualized the data to understand the feature distributions and relationships. Then, I trained a classification algorithm—such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, or Random Forest—to learn patterns that distinguish each species. After evaluating the model's accuracy, I used it to predict the species of new iris flower measurements. This project demonstrates how Python
